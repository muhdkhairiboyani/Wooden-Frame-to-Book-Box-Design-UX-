# Problem
A few clients, in the media & creative industry, dropped by our office inquiring for new packaging ideas for their photobooks. They have done several type of boxes to store their books, such as clamshell boxes, top and bottom boxes or shoe box types and a few others. But they are looking for a box that will store the follwoing specs:

1. A small 8x6 inch photobook
2. Made 100% of wood OR some parts of wood
3. Wood areas can be stained or dye
4. Designs can be printed on
5. Unique

# UX applied during Product Research
Understanding how the clients perceived "What is a good packaging for their photobook" and WHY they want a unique product, are valuable insights when doing product research.

Questions asked:
1. What is your vision of your ideal photobook box?
2. How will you interact with the box?
3. Why is the box important?
4. When will you need the box?

Client's general feedbacks are:
1. We like wooden boxes but it is expensive to make in small quantities.
2. Even if we purchase wooden boxes, we must solve another problem: printing our company's name onto the box, and that will be another add-on cost.
3. We want a unique box, small enough to store our latest photobook (8x6 inch)

# Solution
I converted wooden frames used for stretched canvas into hybrid wooden boxes. I found out that a 12x10 inch frame have an internal clearance space of slightly more than 8x6 inches, and that is a perfect fit for the client's photobook.

# Materials
1. 12x10 inch wooden frame - Either stained or natural
2. 3mm thick gray boards - cut to size to make the cover for the box (for both sides)
3. Allegro 170 gsm paper - to print design and company name
4. Matte Lamination - for printed materials
5. Wood stain OR dye
6. PVC glue
